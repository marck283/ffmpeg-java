# Introduction
This repository holds an implementation of a wrapper for FFmpeg in Java. 
In order to work properly, however, the user needs to install FFmpeg either by 
using *vcpkg* ([see here](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/vcpkg)) 
or by following [this StackExchange answer](https://video.stackexchange.com/a/20496).

## Supported Operating Systems
This library currently supports only Linux and Windows operating systems.
